# Face-Recognition-PSM

Currently doing this facial recognition door lock system.

The first problem I am having right now is to skip the Select User part so I can directly Start the camera instead for facial recognition.

The second problem is to create 2 button inside Check log button that I can open knownlogs.log and unknownlogs.log file.

I hope anyone can help me with this.
